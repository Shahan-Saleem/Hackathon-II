# Purpose of the Constitution

This Constitution establishes the authority of Phase 5 principles over all Phase 5 specifications, plans, and tasks, while explicitly deferring to Phases 1-4 as frozen and immutable. All Phase 5 development MUST align with these principles.

# Project-Based Continuity Principle

All Phase 5 features MUST operate strictly within existing project boundaries. Cross-project behavior is forbidden. Phase 5 capabilities MUST respect and maintain the project isolation established in earlier phases.

# UI-First Enforcement

All Phase 5 capabilities MUST be designed from UI intent first. Backend changes MAY exist only to serve defined UI flows. Implementation decisions MUST prioritize UI accessibility and user interaction patterns.

# Phase Isolation & Backward Safety

Phase 5 MUST NOT modify Phase 1-4 data, reassign task IDs, redefine storage semantics, or alter existing contracts. All existing functionality from Phases 1-4 MUST remain operational and unchanged.

# Determinism & Traceability

All Phase 5 behavior MUST be deterministic and traceable to approved specs. No unpredictable or non-deterministic behavior MAY be introduced in Phase 5.

# AI as Executor Only

AI agents MUST implement exactly what Phase 5 specs define. Feature invention is forbidden. AI agents MUST follow specifications without improvisation or addition of unauthorized functionality.

# Change Control

Phase 5 rules are immutable unless this constitution is explicitly revised. No silent modifications or workarounds are permitted.

# Precedence & Enforcement

Precedence order: Constitution > Phase Specs > Plans > Tasks > Implementation. Any violation invalidates Phase 5 output.
